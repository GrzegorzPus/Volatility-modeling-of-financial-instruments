# üìä Volatility Modeling Of Financial Instruments

Welcome to my Time Series Analysis repository! This repository contains two key projects that involve analyzing financial time series data. Below is a detailed overview of each project:
<br>
<br>
## üìà Project 1: [Microsoft Stock Return Analysis](https://github.com/GrzegorzPus/Volatility-modeling-of-financial-instruments/blob/main/Volatility%20modeling-Microsoft.ipynb)

In this project, I analyzed the returns of Microsoft stock using historical data starting from 2001. The key tasks and findings include:

1. **Return Analysis**:
   - Analyzed Microsoft stock returns and visualized the volatility of returns over time using line charts.

2. **Autocorrelation and Residual Normality**:
   - Examined autocorrelations and tested the normality of residuals to select the appropriate forecasting model.

3. **GARCH Model Building**:
   - Built five different GARCH models to capture volatility and risk associated with the stock returns.

4. **Forecasting**:
   - Utilized the best-performing GARCH model to forecast future stock returns, providing insights for investment strategies.

## üìà Project 2: [CZK/PLN Exchange Rate Return Analysis](https://github.com/GrzegorzPus/Volatility-modeling-of-financial-instruments/blob/main/Volatility%20modeling.R)

The second project focuses on analyzing the returns of the CZK/PLN exchange rate. This analysis was performed using R, and it includes the following key aspects:

1. **Return Analysis**:
   - Analyzed the returns of the CZK/PLN currency pair, exploring volatility and trends over time. Visualizations were created to illustrate the changes in return patterns.

2. **Autocorrelation and Residual Analysis**:
   - Investigated autocorrelations and the normality of residuals to evaluate the characteristics of the exchange rate returns and guide model selection.

3. **GARCH Model Application**:
   - Applied several GARCH models to capture the volatility and risk of the CZK/PLN exchange rate. This step involved comparing different model performances to identify the most effective one.

4. **Forecasting**:
   - Used the best-performing GARCH model to forecast future returns of the CZK/PLN exchange rate, providing insights into currency exchange trends.

## üìà Project 3: [Cointegration Analysis](https://github.com/GrzegorzPus/Volatility-modeling-of-financial-instruments/blob/main/Cointegration%20Study.xlsx)

The third project involves performing a cointegration analysis using Excel. The project includes the following key steps:

1. **Time Series Plotting**:
   - Created time series plots of the modeled data with dates on the x-axis to visualize trends and relationships.

2. **(A)DF Tests**:
   - Conducted Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests on individual variables to check for stationarity.

3. **Engle-Granger Procedure**:
   - Applied the Engle-Granger two-step procedure to test for cointegration between the time series.

4. **ECM Model**:
   - Developed an Error Correction Model (ECM) to describe the short-term dynamics of the cointegrated series.
