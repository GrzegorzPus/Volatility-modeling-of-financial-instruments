```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Import data

The dataset I'll be analyzing concerns the daily exchange rate between the Czech koruna and the Polish z≈Çoty. These data cover the period from January 2, 2014, to February 2, 2024.

```{r cars, include=FALSE}
install.packages("quantmod")
install.packages("xts")
install.packages("fGarch")
install.packages("PerformanceAnalytics")
#install.packages("Closexlsx")
install.packages("rugarch")
install.packages("readxl")

library(quantmod)
library(xts)
library(fGarch)
library(PerformanceAnalytics)
#library(Closexlsx) 
library(rugarch) 
library(readxl)
```

Below are the first five observations:

```{r cars}
head(data_a)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
